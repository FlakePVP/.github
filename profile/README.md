# FlakePVP - Open Sourcing Things For More Fun ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Welcome to the official GitHub of **FlakePVP**‚Äîa hub for high-quality, open-source Minecraft projects. We develop innovative, performance-focused plugins and utilities that enhance Minecraft server experiences, from advanced dueling systems to fast block manipulation tools.

Here, you'll find all of our open-sourced projects.

## Contributing üíñ
Unfortunately, we are not accepting pull requests on GitHub now. However, if you would like to contribute, feel free to apply for a developer role on our Discord.

## Performance over Appearance üñ•Ô∏è
We prioritize performance over appearance, meaning that we'll take in server performance such as CPU, RAM, or SSD usage over the overall "appearance" or feature-richness of our software.

## Recommended Projects To Look Into
- Duel System (not open-sourced)
- SchematicManager
- Flake Core (not open-sourced)

Happy coding!
